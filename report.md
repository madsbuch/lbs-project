title: Preventing timing attacks through the type
author: Erik and Mads

Timing attacks is something programmers traditionally give very little
attention. It is a type of attack that initially seems inconsieveable.
Even after one has concinces herself that timing attacks are real threads,
the prevention mechanisms are hard. We propose a technique to prevent timing
attacks that takes advantage of the type system. The approach forces the 
programmer to prove the absense of timing attacks.

# Introduction

# The Language

## Core Types
As the most important core types we have

* __Unit:__
* __Sum:__
* __Product:__
* __List:__

furthermore we  have some

# Applications
It is hard to directly write in expressed language. Even though we rely on
much inference, the type errors and other things are.
